summary: "The framing was meticulous but a little too restrained. Dialogue stayed sparse, which worked for atmosphere. The color palette carried most of the emotion. A gentle story that could have gone deeper. Still, a memorable closing shot."

The film relies on texture and pacing rather than dialogue, and the last scene lands well.
