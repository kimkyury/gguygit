summary: "The pacing felt deliberate and calm. The silences carried surprising weight. Lighting stayed minimal but precise throughout. A restrained performance that lingered long after. I left with a quiet sense of clarity."

The pacing was deliberate and the silences carried as much weight as the dialogue.
Lighting choices were restrained but precise, making each shift in mood feel earned.

I left the theater with a lingering sense of stillness.
