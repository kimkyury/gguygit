summary: "The opening improvisation felt like a slow inhale. Saxophone tones stayed warm and close. The rhythm section never overstepped, just held space. A set built on quiet momentum and patience. I left feeling steady and restored."

The venue kept the lights low and the sound clear, which made every phrase feel intentional.
Even the pauses sounded composed.
